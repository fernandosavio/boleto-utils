# Boleto Utils

This library aims to parse and extract information from barcodes and digitable lines that follows FEBRABAN and BACEN layouts for "boletos" (brazilian payment slips).

This document will be written in brazilian portuguese because I believe anyone who will actually use it, will be probably brazilian. If I am wrong and you do wish a README in english, please open an issue on GitHub. :)
